# Connect Code

For this project, we've created a [code
repository](https://gitlab.renkulab.io/learn-renku/air-quality-analysis) for this project on GitLab.
We can connect this git repository to our Renku project in order to use it in our session.

Here's how to add the code repository to your project:

1. Click on **+** under the Code Repositories section.
2. Copy and paste the link to Clone with HTTPS from your git project. 
In this case, we already provide you with the code here: 

    ```
    https://gitlab.renkulab.io/learn-renku/air-quality-analysis.git
    ```

You can connect code repositories on GitHub and GitLab.com, too. Check out the **Integrations** page (accessible via the ðŸ‘¤ user menu in the top right) to connect your accounts and sync access to repositories. For more information, see [How to connect your Renku account to your GitHub or GitLab account](/docs/users/code/guides/connect-renku-account-to-github-or-gitlab-account).
And, if your institution has a dedicated GitLab instance you would like to integrate with Renku, do not hesitate to [Contact](/docs/users/community)  us, and we will be happy to add it to the list.
