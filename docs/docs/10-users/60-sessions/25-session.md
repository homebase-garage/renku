# Session

A Renku session is a running interactive run-time environment that can be used to do work on data and code.

A session is created by a [Session Launcher](/docs/users/sessions/session-launcher) and is a running instance of an [Environment](/docs/users/sessions/environment). Inside a session, all of the projectâ€™s  [Code repository](/docs/users/code/code-repository)s are cloned and [Data connector](/docs/users/data/data)s are mounted (as long as the user provided any required access credentials).

A session has access to a certain amount of compute resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage). This is determined by the resource pool set on the [Session Launcher](/docs/users/sessions/session-launcher). For more information about compute resources, see [Resource Pools & Classes](/docs/users/sessions/resource-pools-and-classes).

The sessions you launch are always private to you.
