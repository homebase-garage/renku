# Create a project

Work in Renku is organized around projects: a **project** is the core building block where you
connect data sources, code repositories and compute environments (for running sessions). You can
grant access to a project to your colleagues and collaborators, or even share some elements (code,
data or compute environments) of your project to a broader audience.

To create a new project:

1. Click ➕ at the top right corner of [renkulab.io](http://renkulab.io) after logging in.
    1. Click on **Project**.

2. On the project creation page
    - **Name**: Enter the project identifier.
    - **Owner**: Decide whether the project should be under your user space or under a group you belong to.
    - **Visibility**: Set it either to be **Public** or **Private**.
    - **Description (optional)**: Fill in the description for the project.

3. Add the data for your project. See our collection of [Guides](/docs/users/data/guides/connect-data) for options for creating data connectors.

4. Add code repository as explained in [How to add a code repository to your project](/docs/users/code/guides/add-code-repository-to-project).
5. Create a session launcher for working in your project:
    1. Select an environment:
        1. Check out the environments available in Renku via [How to add a session launcher to your project](/docs/users/sessions/guides/add-session-launcher-to-project). If these are sufficient for your project, use them!
        2. If you need to customize the environment for your project, you can create a custom environment yourself via [How to use your own docker image for a Renku session](/docs/users/sessions/guides/use-your-own-docker-image-for-renku-session), or  [Contact](/docs/users/community) us if you are in trouble!
    2. Set the session launcher’s default resource class for your project [How to select compute resources for your session](/docs/users/sessions/guides/select-compute-resources-for-session).

        :::info

        In order to ensure adequate resources for running the project and to control the consumption
        of the sessions, remember to assign to the session launcher with the adequate resource class
        when adding the session launcher to your project.
